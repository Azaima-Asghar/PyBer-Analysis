# *PyBer-Analysis with Matplotlib*
Visualizing  Ride-Sharing Data.

## *Introduction*

PyBer is a python based ride sharing app company. The task of this project is to perform exploratory analysis on data in some very large csv files. To aid this process several types of visualizations are created to tell a compelling story about the data. 

Python scripts are written using pandas libraries, a Jupyter notebook and matplotlib to create a variety of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and reels as well as total percentage of fares, rides and drivers by the type of the city. 

The analysis results and the visualizations performed will help pyber company improve access to ride sharing services and determine afforabilitly for under-served neighborhoods.

## *Resources*
* Data Sources: city_data.csv and ride_data.csv (present in the resources folder).
* Open-source distribution software Anaconda and the Jupiter notebook.
* Pandas, NumPy, Matpoltlib and SciPy libraries for python.

Both the data sets, city and ride data sets were cleaned by checking if there was any null or missing value in the data sets. After the cleaning both the data sets were merged into one data set. The anaylsis was performed on the merged data set. 

## *Results*

A bubble chart that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the average number of drivers of each city type: urban, suburban, and rural was created. The following is the image.
